## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **web developer** with a strong focus on front-end and full-stack development. Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience with a variety of programming languages and frameworks. I am deeply interested in **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Node.js**, and I love building applications that are not only functional but also delightful to use.

I’m constantly learning and exploring new technologies and techniques, whether it's diving deeper into **backend development**, enhancing my **problem-solving skills**, or getting more familiar with databases like **MongoDB** and **MySQL**.

- 👀 **I’m currently learning**: Backend development with Node.js, GraphQL, and improving my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on**: Open-source projects, building cool web apps, and tech innovations. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations. 
- 🧠 **My current focus**: Improving my skills in **server-side development** and working on **optimizing web performance**.
